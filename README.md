This Stata code was for the working paper "Who Gets MyMedicare and When? Patient Characteristics and the Likelihood of Registration". The code does a small clean on the POLAR dataset and then merges in the MyMedicare treated and never treated (control) groups. It then sets the data up to run a (1) binary logistic regression (never treated vs treated) and (2) multinomial logistic regression (never treated vs early, mid, and late treated). Estimates from each regression model are stored (Odds ratios and relative risk ratios for each covariate) and a fancy two-panel 'coefplot' is constructed, vertically plotting the coefficient estiamtes and 95% confidence intervals for each covariate.
