This code does a small clean on the POLAR dataset and then merges in the MyMedicare treated and never treated (control) groups. It then sets the data up to run a (1) binary logistic regression (never treated vs treated) and multinomial logistic regression (never treated vs early, mid, and late treated). Estimates from each regression model are stored (Odds ratios and relative risk ratios) and a fancy two-panel 'coefplot' is constructed, vertically plotting the estiamtes and 95% confidence intervals for each covariate.
